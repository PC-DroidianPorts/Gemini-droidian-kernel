# Gemini-droidian-kernel

This is the kernel code for geminipda on droidian.
To build the kernel use the droidian docker image, instruction located at https://github.com/droidian/porting-guide or https://github.com/FakeShell/porting-guide
This is a copy of the geminipda kernel from https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android9/planet-geminipda/kernel-planet-geminipda. My thanks to @notkit for the updated source code.
